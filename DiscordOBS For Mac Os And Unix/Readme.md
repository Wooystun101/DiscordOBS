-Built By Wooystun#0005-

===================== Requirements =================
- Make sure You Have Python 3.5 Or Later (Only tested On Python 3.6, so 3.6 is prob best)
- Discord.py NONREWRITE REQUIRED.
- You Can Put Your Own Gifs And Audio In, Just be sure to name it the same as the original files. On Windows, Make sure it has .gif in the name for the gif, and .mp3 in the name of the audio, Since windows adds the file type at the end, it is looking for "Audio_1.mp3.mp3" And "Animation_1.gif.gif"
- Your Own Discord Bot.
- Obs STUDIO

============= If You Dont alrighty Have Python Or Pip ==============
-  If You Do not Have Python, A Python 3.6 installer is in the requirments folder, be sure to run that. The Installer itself will run the installer for pip, so you don't have to worry,
-
===================== Directions For Users Without Python ========================

1. Go to the requirements folder, And Run The Python 3.6.8 Installer

2. Run Setup.py

3. In Setup.py, When It asks you weather or not you have pip installed, say no. The Installer will then install pip, And use pip to install the rest of the modules, like discord.py, the gui, etc.

4. Go Through the setup normally, Inputing required stuff.

5. After you complete the setup.py, Run Config.py.

6. While the Config.py File Is Running, Go to the server with the server id you have the bot linked to. Then Say "!configwindow", This will open up a new window with your gif and text. From Here, Put it into OBS, As A Window capture.

7. Then, Quit the Config.py File, And Your Finished!!

=================== Directions For Users With python ==========================
1. Launch The "Setup.py" file

2. If you don't have pip, Say no when it asks you if you have pip installed. Otherwise, if you have pip installed, say yes and skip the install of get-pip.py

3. After you complete the setup.py, Run Config.py.

4. While the Config.py File Is Running, Go to the server with the server id you have the bot linked to. Then Say "!configwindow", This will open up a new window with your gif and text. From Here, Put it into OBS, As A Window capture.

5. Then, Quit the Config.py File, And Your Finished!!

=======================---- Known Bugs ----=========================
- A Bug Has Been Found Where After the script closes the window With the text and gif, The Window Freezes in obs. Unfortunately, Since As Far As We Can tell, This IS NOT The Script, And Is A Problem with obs, There is no Known fix for this other than Restarting Obs.
(Of course, This can also be bypassed if you use display capture tho)

- A Common Bug is that Sometimes, The Audio And Gif Are Delayed.

- The Script requires a Restart Everytime Someone joins.

- The Script COULD Crash if 2 or more people join within a 15 - 20 second period, or the text may show the same user (being the latest one) twice.

================------- Minimum System Requirments -----======================
- Mac OS X 10.11 or Later, Windows 7 or Later, Linux/X11 Or Later 
- 4GB Of Ram Or Higher
- Intel i5 Or AMD FX series recommended (can also run on dual-core and quad-core)

All Minimum Requirments were pulled from the highest minimum requirments from the api's, discord, and obs's websites respectively
